### Transactions phase
In the transactions phase we once again deliver a customizable solution powered by smart contracts. With the DEED of Sale contract an involved escrow takes place between the parties involved. The buyers address must also be the one depositing the funds into the contract. The seller controls the transfer of the SWAP DEED. After being notified of buyer’s deposit and physical transfer being made the seller will then send over the SWAP DEED as proof of ownership via owing the original tokenized DEED and the new DEED of Sale. All this power come from the embracing of embodiment in blockchain. Verify and solidify with SwapOut.
